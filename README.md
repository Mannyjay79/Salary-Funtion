## üîç Instructor Feedback & Improvements

You have done a solid job overall‚Äîgreat work importing the data, creating a functional employee lookup, incorporating error handling, and exporting to CSV. Your R script also effectively unzips and displays the dataset, and your README is clear and informative.

However, I noticed two key issues:

1. **Duplicate Employee Names:**
   - The dictionary conversion in Python failed due to non-unique employee names, which led to a `ValueError`.
   - ‚úÖ Suggestion: Use a composite key (e.g., name + year) or use `.groupby()` or `defaultdict`.

2. **Missing Folder Zipping:**
   - The export function didn‚Äôt zip the output folder as required.
   - ‚úÖ Suggestion: Added zip export using Python‚Äôs `zipfile` module to meet assignment requirements.
